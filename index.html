  <p>A farmer grows his flock of sheep to 495 and realizes that his sheepdog is ready for retirement, so he goes
    to a pet store and asks the clerk for the best sheepdog he sells.</p>
  <p>"This is the best one," the clerk said. "He speaks four languages, plays chess and recites Shakespeare on command."</p>
  <p>"He's right," the dog says. "I'm the best sheepdog there is."</p>
  <p>"That's all well and good," says the farmer, "but can you round up 495 sheep every day?"</p>
  <p>"I can round up as many sheep as you want," the dog replies.</p>
  <p>Impressed, the farmer buys the dog. He takes him to the top of a hill overlooking his pasture to look out over his 495 sheep.</p>
  <p>"Alright, round them up," he tells the dog.</p>
  <p>The dog looks thoughtfully at the flock for a moment before telling the farmer, "You have 500 sheep."</p>
